# CODEL

**CODEL** is a daily coding challenge game designed to combine learning and fun. Every day at midnight, a new coding prompt is released. Users can type Python code into a provided function skeleton, run their code, or submit it for grading. Submissions are tested against predefined cases, with real-time feedback visualized through a grid: green for passing tests and red for failing ones. The goal is to complete all test cases in the least number of attempts, with time serving as a tiebreaker.

## Motivation

This project was developed to showcase our full-stack development skills, including front-end design, back-end logic, and database management. Beyond technical demonstration, CODEL aims to motivate students and aspiring programmers to practice coding through an engaging, game-like platform. By turning LeetCode-style challenges into a daily competition, CODEL encourages Python learners and computer science majors to improve their problem-solving skills in a fun, interactive way.
