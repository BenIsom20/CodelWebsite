challenge:
  name: "Intersection of Two Arrays II"
  date: "2025-01-29"
  function:
    name: "intersect"
    parameters: ["nums1", "nums2"]
  prompt: |
    given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.
    Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.
    Good luck.

  cases:
    - prompt: "Check intersection of [1, 2, 2, 1] and [2, 2] (base case: common elements with duplicates)"
      given_data: "[1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2]"
      expected: "[2, 2]"

    - prompt: "Check intersection of [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] (edge case: no common elements)"
      given_data: "[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]"
      expected: "[]"

    - prompt: "Check intersection of [1] and [1] (base case: single element match)"
      given_data: "[1], [1]"
      expected: "[1]"

    - prompt: "Check intersection of [2, 2, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 2] (edge case: multiple duplicates)"
      given_data: "[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]"
      expected: "[2, 2, 2]"

    - prompt: "Check intersection of [] and [1, 2, 3] (edge case: empty first array)"
      given_data: "[], [1, 2, 3]"
      expected: "[]"
