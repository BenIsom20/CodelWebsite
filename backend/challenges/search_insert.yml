  name: "Search Insert Position"
  date: "2025-02-08"
  function:
    name: "searchInsert"
    parameters: ["nums", "target"]
  prompt: |
    given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
    If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
    Good luck.

  cases:
    - prompt: "Find index of 5 in [1, 3, 5, 6] (target exists in array)"
      given_data: "[1, 3, 5, 6], 5"
      expected: 2

    - prompt: "Find index of 2 in [1, 3, 5, 6] (target does not exist in array)"
      given_data: "[1, 3, 5, 6], 2"
      expected: 1

    - prompt: "Find index of 7 in [1, 3, 5, 6] (edge case: target is greater than all elements)"
      given_data: "[1, 3, 5, 6], 7"
      expected: 4

    - prompt: "Find index of 0 in [1, 3, 5, 6] (edge case: target is less than all elements)"
      given_data: "[1, 3, 5, 6], 0"
      expected: 0
