  name: "Valid Perfect Square"
  date: "2025-02-14"
  function:
    name: "is_perfect_square"
    parameters: ["num"]
  prompt: |
    given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
    A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
    You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt. 
    Good luck.

  cases:
    - prompt: "Check if 1 is a perfect square (edge case: smallest valid perfect square)"
      given_data: "1"
      expected: "true"

    - prompt: "Check if 2147395600 is a perfect square (edge case: large perfect square)"
      given_data: "2147395600"
      expected: "true"

    - prompt: "Check if 16 is a perfect square (edge case: normal perfect square)"
      given_data: "16"
      expected: "true"

    - prompt: "Check if -4 is a perfect square (edge case: negative number, not valid for perfect square)"
      given_data: "-4"
      expected: "false"
