challenge:
  name: "Triangle"
  date: "2025-02-11"
  function:
    name: "minimumTotal"
    parameters: ["triangle"]
  prompt: |
    given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.
    For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.
    Good luck.

  cases:
    - prompt: "Find the minimum path sum of the triangle"
      given_data: "[[2], [3,4], [6,5,7], [4,1,8,3]]"
      expected: 11

    - prompt: "Find the minimum path sum of the triangle of a single element array"
      given_data: "[[-10]]"
      expected: -10

    - prompt: "Find the minimum path sum of the triangle with negatives"
      given_data: "[[-1], [2,2], [1,-1,-3]]"
      expected: -2

    - prompt: "Find the minimum path sum of the triangle where a greedy algo doesn't work"
      given_data: "[[2], [3,4], [9,4,1], [5,6,8,7]]"
      expected: 14
