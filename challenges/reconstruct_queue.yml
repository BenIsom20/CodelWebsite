challenge:
  name: "Queue Reconstruction by Height"
  date: "2025-01-04"
  function:
    name: "reconstruct_queue"
    parameters: ["people"]
  prompt: |
    "Write a Python function that takes an array 'people', where each element is a pair [hi, ki]. 
    'hi' is the height of a person, and 'ki' is the number of people in front of them who have a height greater than or equal to 'hi'.
    Reconstruct and return the queue that satisfies these conditions. The input array is not necessarily sorted.
    The returned queue should be an array where queue[j] = [hj, kj] represents the person at position 'j'."

  cases:
    - prompt: "Reconstruct a queue from an example with mixed heights and positions"
      given_data: "[[7, 0], [4, 4], [7, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [5, 2]]"
      expected: "[[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]"

    - prompt: "Reconstruct a queue with increasing heights and mixed positions"
      given_data: "[[6, 0], [5, 0], [4, 0], [3, 2], [2, 2], [1, 4]]"
      expected: "[[4, 0], [5, 0], [2, 2], [3, 2], [1, 4], [6, 0]]"
